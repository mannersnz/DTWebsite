<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Services component with three service cards</name>
  <files>src/components/Services.astro</files>
  <action>
    Create Services.astro in src/components/ following established patterns from ValueProp.astro.

    **Structure:**
    - Section with light gray background (bg-gray-50) to contrast with white ValueProp
    - Container with max-width (max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 py-16 md:py-24)
    - Section heading centered
    - Three-column grid for services (grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-8)

    **Three Services (from PROJECT.md):**

    1. **AI Strategy Sessions**
       - Icon: 🎯 (target/strategy)
       - Headline: "AI Strategy Sessions"
       - Description: "Discover where AI can make the biggest impact in your business. We'll identify quick wins and create a practical roadmap tailored to your goals."
       - Subtext: "Perfect for: Business owners starting their AI journey"

    2. **AI Tool Training**
       - Icon: 🎓 (education/training)
       - Headline: "AI Tool Training"
       - Description: "Get your team confident with AI tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, and more. Hands-on workshops focused on your actual workflows."
       - Subtext: "Perfect for: Teams ready to boost productivity"

    3. **AI Implementation**
       - Icon: 🚀 (launch/implementation)
       - Headline: "AI Implementation"
       - Description: "From pilot to production. We'll help you integrate AI tools into your existing processes with minimal disruption."
       - Subtext: "Perfect for: Businesses ready to scale AI adoption"

    **Card styling (enhanced from ValueProp pattern):**
    - Each card: bg-white rounded-xl p-8 shadow-sm border border-gray-100
    - Larger padding than ValueProp cards (p-8 vs p-6)
    - Icon: text-4xl mb-4
    - Headline: text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3
    - Description: text-gray-600 mb-4
    - Subtext: text-sm text-blue-600 font-medium (differentiates target audience)

    **Section heading:**
    - "Our Services" or "How We Can Help"
    - Centered, text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4
    - Optional subheading: "From strategy to implementation, we've got you covered"

    Use TypeScript interface for service type (like ValuePillar in ValueProp).

  <done>Services component with three service cards ready for use</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Integrate Services into homepage</name>
  <files>src/pages/index.astro</files>
  <action>
    Update src/pages/index.astro:

    1. Import Services component: `import Services from '../components/Services.astro';`
    2. Add Services below ValueProp component
    3. Remove placeholder comment

    **Updated structure:**
    ```astro
    ---
    import MainLayout from '../layouts/MainLayout.astro';
    import Hero from '../components/Hero.astro';
    import ValueProp from '../components/ValueProp.astro';
    import Services from '../components/Services.astro';
    ---

    <MainLayout
      title="Digital Tempo - AI Consulting for NZ Businesses"
      description="Practical AI consulting to help NZ businesses get productive with AI in weeks, not months"
    >
      <Hero />
      <ValueProp />
      <Services />
      <!-- About section will be added in Phase 4 -->
    </MainLayout>
    ```

    Ensure visual flow: Hero (gradient) → ValueProp (white) → Services (gray-50) → Footer (dark)
  </action>
  <verify>npm run dev shows Services section below ValueProp on homepage</verify>
  <done>Homepage displays Hero, ValueProp, and Services sections in sequence</done>
</task>
