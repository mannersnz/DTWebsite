<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create About component with story and trust elements</name>
  <files>src/components/About.astro</files>
  <action>
    Create About.astro in src/components/ following established patterns.

    **Structure:**
    - Section with white background (contrast with gray-50 Services above)
    - Container with max-width (max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 py-16 md:py-24)
    - Two-column layout on desktop: Story on left, trust elements on right
    - Stacks on mobile

    **Left Column - The Story:**
    - Section heading: "About Digital Tempo"
    - Subheading or intro: "Your trusted AI advisor"

    **Story content (from PROJECT.md context):**
    ```
    Digital Tempo has been helping New Zealand businesses navigate technology
    for years. Now, we're focused on what matters most: helping you harness
    the power of AI tools to work smarter, not harder.

    We're not here to sell you complex AI systems or research projects.
    We're here to show you practical ways to use AI tools like ChatGPT,
    Copilot, and others to get real results — quickly.
    ```

    **Right Column - Trust Elements (as a list or cards):**

    Three trust points with icons:

    1. **Vendor-Agnostic**
       - Icon: ⚖️ (balance/neutral)
       - "We recommend what works for you, not what earns us commissions. No vendor lock-in, no hidden agendas."

    2. **Practical Experience**
       - Icon: 💼 (business/experience)
       - "Years of IT consulting experience means we understand business realities, not just technology possibilities."

    3. **Local Understanding**
       - Icon: 🇳🇿 (NZ flag)
       - "Based in New Zealand, we know the local business landscape and work in your timezone."

    **Visual styling:**
    - Left column: prose styling, readable paragraph text
    - Right column: trust cards similar to ValueProp pillars
    - Desktop: grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-12
    - Mobile: single column stack

    Use established card patterns from ValueProp.astro.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Integrate About into homepage</name>
  <files>src/pages/index.astro</files>
  <action>
    Update src/pages/index.astro:

    1. Import About component: `import About from '../components/About.astro';`
    2. Add About below Services component
    3. Update placeholder comment for next phase

    **Updated structure:**
    ```astro
    ---
    import MainLayout from '../layouts/MainLayout.astro';
    import Hero from '../components/Hero.astro';
    import ValueProp from '../components/ValueProp.astro';
    import Services from '../components/Services.astro';
    import About from '../components/About.astro';
    ---

    <MainLayout
      title="Digital Tempo - AI Consulting for NZ Businesses"
      description="Practical AI consulting to help NZ businesses get productive with AI in weeks, not months"
    >
      <Hero />
      <ValueProp />
      <Services />
      <About />
      <!-- Contact section will be added in Phase 5 -->
    </MainLayout>
    ```

    Visual flow: Hero (gradient) → ValueProp (white) → Services (gray-50) → About (white) → Footer (dark)
  </action>
  <verify>npm run dev shows About section below Services on homepage</verify>
