# Digital Tempo Website

## What This Is

A modern website for Digital Tempo, a New Zealand-based consulting company pivoting from traditional IT consulting to AI consulting and training services. The site targets small-medium businesses in New Zealand who want to adopt AI tools quickly and practically.

## Core Value

Get SMBs productive with AI in weeks, not months — practical quick wins over complex long-term projects.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Homepage with clear AI consulting value proposition
- [ ] Services section: AI Strategy Sessions, AI Tool Training, AI Implementation
- [ ] About section explaining the Digital Tempo approach to AI consulting
- [ ] Contact section with existing contact details (hello@digitaltempo.nz, +64 21 567119)
- [ ] Retain existing Digital Tempo logo and brand identity
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] Clear calls-to-action for SMB owners to get in touch

### Out of Scope

- Custom ML/deep learning services — focus is on practical AI tool adoption, not building custom models
- Enterprise-scale deployments — target market is SMBs, not large corporations
- E-commerce or payment processing — this is a consulting services site
- Blog or content management system — keep it simple for v1
- Client portal or login functionality — not needed for initial launch

## Context

**Current State:**
- Existing website at www.digitaltempo.nz built on Squarespace
- Current services: Virtual CIO, Project Management, Modern Ways of Working (Agile)
- Established brand with logo (digital_tempo_horizontal_small.png)
- Existing tagline: "Your trusted digital advisor"

**Pivot:**
- Moving from general IT consulting to AI-focused consulting
- Same trusted advisor positioning, now applied to AI adoption
- Leveraging IT consulting experience to help SMBs navigate AI

**Target Audience:**
- Small-medium business owners in New Zealand
- Non-technical decision makers who want to understand AI
- Businesses looking for practical, quick wins with AI tools

**Competitive Positioning:**
- Vendor-agnostic (not selling specific AI products)
- Practical, quick-win focused (not academic or research-oriented)
- NZ-based, understanding local business context

## Constraints

- **Branding**: Must use existing Digital Tempo logo
- **Contact**: Retain existing email (hello@digitaltempo.nz) and phone (+64 21 567119)
- **Market**: New Zealand focus, NZD currency
- **Simplicity**: Clean, modern design matching current brand aesthetic

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Focus on SMBs, not enterprises | Matches existing client base and avoids competing with large consultancies | — Pending |
| Three service tiers (Strategy, Training, Implementation) | Covers full adoption journey while keeping offering clear | — Pending |
| Exclude custom ML/deep learning | Focus on practical tool adoption, not research/development | — Pending |
